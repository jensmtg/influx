See more than just links - **Influx** shows actual excerpts from your notes, giving you context instead of just connections. Customize what you see and how you see it, making backlinks actually _useful_ for research and discovery.

### Why Influx over core backlinks?

- **Rich context**: See excerpts instead of just link titles
- **Smart organization**: Automatically groups by bullet point hierarchy  
- **Full control**: Customize sorting, layout, and filtering
- **Research ready**: Perfect for academic work and deep knowledge discovery

#### Perfect for productivity enthusiasts and academics who want to:

- See the actual content around their links, not just the links themselves  
- Customize how backlinks are displayed and organized
- Turn their note connections into genuine insights
- Build knowledge webs that are actually useful

> _"I much prefer Influx over the core Backlinks plugin"_

Join users who've discovered that seeing your connections shouldn't mean losing the context.
