<!-- ![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jensmtg/influx?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver) -->

Similar to the *backlinks* core plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but made to display relevant and formatted excerpts from notes with linked mentions, based on the position of mentions in the notes' hierarchical structure (bullet level indentation).

## Suggested usage pattern

(Or: How to get the most out of this plugin.)

* Information should mainly be written in daily (or Zettelkasten-ish) notes. Topical notes will then mainly be aggregates of clippings from daily notes.
* Notes should be taken hierarchically, in the form of bullet lists/*bullet journaling*. This helps keep clippings terse and relevant.
* Links should be used as the only organizing principle in the vault - forgo use of tags and files/folders. This helps with completeness; the plugin only considers links when aggregating.
